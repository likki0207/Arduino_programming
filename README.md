# Arduino programming
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

# Project-1 : Third Eye for Blind with Vibrating Ultrasonic Glove

The “Third Eye for Blind with Vibrating Ultrasonic Glove”, is designed to help the blind to overcome the lack of visual sense, 
by using other senses like sound and touch. It uses audio and vibration signals to notify the user about upcoming hurdle. 
As the distance between glove and obstacle decreases, frequency of both audio and vibration signals increases. 
Thus the system helps to ease the navigation process for the needy.
The system uses Atmega-328 microcontroller, which is a high performance 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller

# Project-2 : Accident avoidance system
This is an Arduino-based collision detection warning system.
This kind of system is the fastest growing safety feature in automotive industries. 
Such a system enables vehicles to identify the chances of collision and give visual and audio warning to driver, 
so that the driver can take necessary action to avoid collision.
Collision avoidance is a critical issue for any mobile robot. 
Thus, every mobile robot uses a method to avoid obstacles and collisions. 
Each method has its own different characteristics. The differences could be in the algorithms of avoiding collisions, 
the chips that control the robot or the sensors that detects obstacles in the surrounding area. Having reliable sensors in mobile robots is one of the most important things that researchers are working on them. 
Various types of sensors are used in robots to avoid collisions, like bump sensors, infrared sensors, laser range sensor and ultrasonic sensors. 
Ultrasonic sensors proved their high abilities of detecting obstacles in wide ranges, and they are commonly used in mobile robots to avoid collisions. 
Recent studies have presented and improved various methods of avoiding collisions using ultrasonic sensors.
